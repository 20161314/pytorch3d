"""
This functionality allows a configurable system to be determined in a dataclass-type
way. It is a generalization of omegaconf's "structured", in the dataclass case.
Core functionality:

- Configurable -- A base class used to label a class as being one which uses this
                    system. Uses class members and __post_init__ like a dataclass.

- expand_args_fields -- Expands a class like `dataclasses.dataclass`. Runs automatically.

- get_default_args -- gets an omegaconf.DictConfig for initializing
                       a given class or calling a given function.

- run_auto_creation -- Initialises nested members. To be called in __post_init__.


In addition, a Configurable may contain members whose type is decided at runtime.

- ReplaceableBase -- As a base instead of Configurable, labels a class to say that
                     any child class can be used instead.

- registry -- A global store of named child classes of  ReplaceableBase classes.
              Used as `@registry.register` decorator on class definition.


Additional utility functions:

- remove_unused_components -- used for simplifying a DictConfig instance.
- get_default_args_field -- default for DictConfig member of another configurable.


1. The simplest usage of this functionality is as follows. First a schema is defined
in dataclass style.

    class A(Configurable):
        n: int = 9

    class B(Configurable):
        a: A

        def __post_init__(self):
            run_auto_creation(self)

It can be used like

    b_args = get_default_args(B)
    b = B(**b_args)

In this case, get_default_args(B) returns an omegaconf.DictConfig with the right
members {"a_args": {"n": 9}}. It also modifies the definitions of the classes to
something like the following. (The modification itself is done by the function
`expand_args_fields`, which is called inside `get_default_args`.)

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class A:
        n: int = 9

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class B:
        a_args: DictConfig = dataclasses.field(default_factory=lambda: DictConfig({"n": 9}))

        def __post_init__(self):
            self.a = A(**self.a_args)

2. Pluggability. Instead of a dataclass-style member being given a concrete class,
you can give a base class and the implementation is looked up by name in the global
`registry` in this module. E.g.

    class A(ReplaceableBase):
        k: int = 1

    @registry.register
    class A1(A):
        m: int = 3

    @registry.register
    class A2(A):
        n: str = "2"

    class B(Configurable):
        a: A
        a_class_type: str = "A2"

        def __post_init__(self):
            run_auto_creation(self)

will expand to

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class A:
        k: int = 1

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class A1(A):
        m: int = 3

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class A2(A):
        n: str = "2"

    @dataclasses.dataclass
    class B:
        a_class_type: str = "A2"
        a_A1_args: DictConfig = dataclasses.field(
            default_factory=lambda: DictConfig({"k": 1, "m": 3}
        )
        a_A2_args: DictConfig = dataclasses.field(
            default_factory=lambda: DictConfig({"k": 1, "m": 3}
        )

        def __post_init__(self):
            if self.a_class_type == "A1":
                self.a = A1(**self.a_A1_args)
            elif self.a_class_type == "A2":
                self.a = A2(**self.a_A2_args)
            else:
                raise ValueError(...)

3. Aside from these classes, the members of these classes should be things
which DictConfig is happy with: e.g. (bool, int, str, None, float) and what
can be built from them with DictConfigs and lists of them.

In addition, you can call get_default_args on a function or class to get
the DictConfig of its defaulted arguments, assuming those are all things
which DictConfig is happy with. If you want to use such a thing as a member
of another configured class, `get_default_args_field` is a helper.
